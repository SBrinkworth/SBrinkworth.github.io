The user can select from two options, the pokedex or the pokeforums. In the pokedex it gives you a list of pokemon to choose from on the left side of the screen. On the right side of the screen is where the pokemon info is desplayed. In the forums, the user can register and login, and then all of the forum threads are displayed. when a thread is selected, the user is taken to that thread and can post and read other posts as they are created.
